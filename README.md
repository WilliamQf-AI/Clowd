# What is Clowd?

Clowd is a minimalist screen capture / screen recording tool. It sits out of your way in your system tray, and is activated when you press the `PrntScr` key.

The latest "stable" release can always be downloaded from here. If you are looking for the "beta", you should update via the app settings.

I will respond to bug reports or questions in GitHub issues. Also feel free to bug me (@caesay) in the Clowd Discord server:

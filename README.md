This readme is mostly a TODO like everything else in this project. 

## What is Clowd?

Clowd sits out of your way in your system tray. It provides the following features:

 - Super duper awesome PrntScr replacement
   - Uses Direct3D so is super fast and responsive
   - Scroll to zoom in on any part of your screen, pixel perfect selections (or just looking at stuff on your screen closely)
   - Has great and obvious hotkeys
   - Snaps selection to window borders
 - Good color picker
 - Basic but easy to use screenshot editor
 - Two-click video recorder that can snap to a window, a monitor, or span multiple displays.

People are probably mostly here for the PrntScr replacement or the video recording. Those features are really great. The rest is mostly a work in progress.

## How can I get it?

The latest "stable" release can always be downloaded from here. I will try not to totally break things. 

https://clowd-releases.s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com/stable/ClowdSetup.exe

You can upgrade to the "experimental" channel via the app settings. I don't recommend it. It's broken most of the time.

## I haz bug?

I will respond to bug reports or questions in GitHub issues. Also feel free to bug me (@caesay) in our Discord:
